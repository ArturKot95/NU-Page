Therefore, the registration process may take several days or even weeks, depending on the city, the embassies or the time of year.
                                            </p>

                                            <p class="text-justify">When applying for a long-term student visa to the Czech Republic you may be interviewed by the Czech officer.

                                        In the Czech Republic, the rental payment is approximately 2500-3500 CZK (90-130 EUR)
                                        per month. The final cost depends on the type of the room, and the number of roommates.
                                        Food and clothing costs are approximately 4000 CZK (150 EUR). The payments for
                                        leisure time are also very individual. If you wish to go out to clubs and restaurants
                                        with your friends, expect to spend at least 1000 CZK (40 EUR) or more. The university
                                        fee (for registration, student card, etc.) in the Czech Republic is approximately 300 CZK (11 EUR).

                                        of 200 PLN (50 EUR). The food and clothing spending is very similar to the Czech

                    <p>
                        Most of the graduates continue with master studies – they often choose another study in
                        English in a foreign country and choose majors such as international management, economics or IT.
                        Neisse programs give a perfect opportunity to try yourself in (the) different areas and to choose
                        the best master program to continue with your education.
                        Graduates can start their professional career in key areas of international business administration
                        like marketing, corporate finance, accounting, management. Also, the fields of economy, computer
                        science or even running your own business are common career paths after the graduation.

                                    “I had decided to continue my studies at Hochschule Zittau/Görlitz (Informatics) after
                                    graduation at Neisse University. During my master studies, I applied for a job at Toyota
                                    Peugeot Citroen Automobile (TPCA) to become Information Systems specialist. I was hired
                                    immediately thanks to all the things I have learned while studying at Neisse University
                                    and HSZG. I had deep knowledge about trends in IT plus my communication skills were high
                                    above average in the TPCA IS department. I personally recommend studying at Neisse University
                                    to everyone I meet. Neisse University is not only about the subject “Information and
                                    communication management”. It is a school of life – you live abroad, you feed yourself,
                                    you deal with other people, you have the possibility to speak four languages a day, etc.
                                    And there is a bonus of an incredible looking CV which unlocks the first door to your dream career.”

                                            While Neisse provided me mostly with hard skills as computer literacy, CEMS Master in
                                            International Management is a more business-focused program. After spending an
                                            exhausting semester at prestigious Rotterdam School of Management and three semesters
                                            at the University of Economics, Prague, I am now about to finish it. During the past
                                            two years, I have gained professional experience through various internships in banking,
                                            management consulting and FMCG (fast moving consumer goods). Neisse University is
                                            definitely a step out of your comfort zone - studying with foreigners in English,
                                            moving in and out, subjects that range from programming to psychology. But without
                                            it, I would not have been able to achieve what I did, both personally and professionally.
                                            Last but not least, one gets to know amazing people. Neisse University opened me the door
                                            to pursue an international career. If you are not sure what you want to do but you want
                                            to work around the world, I can only recommend applying as this is a really great start
                                            that can help you to find your way.”</p>

                                            the study group have been stuck in my memory. To my mind, the seminars and lectures
                                            built a good knowledge base, and I was able to apply a few learned skills later
                                            in my career. Having selected a rather untypical course of studies attracted attention
                                            for further applications and has eventually been a great stepping stone for my academic
                                            and professional career. Due to the English-speaking environment at Neisse as well
                                            as the flexibility and openness gained there I was well prepared for my master studies
                                            that I completed entirely abroad. Currently works for Zürich Versicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft
                                            as communications manager.”</p>

                                            bored with your study and will provide constant stimulation to try new things.
                                            The program has all advantages of the Erasmus exchange program but additionally
                                            offers security and peace of mind - the accommodation and formal issues are taken care of for you.

                    No, it is not. An intermediate level (B1) of English is enough. You will take an intensive two-week
                    English course just before studies begin. The study group is international which means you will speak
                    English on a daily basis. Your English language skills will improve rapidly and English will become
                    second nature to you. Before the first examination period your language skills will improve more then you can imagine.
